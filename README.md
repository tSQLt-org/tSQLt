tSQLt is a unit testing framework for Microsoft SQL Server. 
It is compatible with SQL Server 2005 (service pack 2 required) and above on all editions.

tSQLt allows you to implement unit tests in T-SQL. This is important as you do not have to switch between various tools to create your code and your unit tests. tSQLt also provides the following features to make it easier to create and manage unit tests:

* Tests are automatically run within transactions – this keeps tests independent and reduces any cleanup work you need
* Tests can be grouped together within a schema – allowing you to organize your tests and use common setup methods
* Output can be generated in plain text or XML – making it easier to integrate with a continuous integration tool
