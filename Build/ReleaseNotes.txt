===================
An online version of these release notes is available at:
http://tsqlt.org/category/release-notes/


---------------------------
Release: VLATEST-BUILD-NUMBER

BUG FIXES:

N/A

NEW FEATURES:

1. tSQLt can now be installed using DACPACs as well as the original tSQLt.class.sql script. Note: Unlike the original tSQLt.class.sql script, DACPACs are SQL Server version specific.
2. tSQLt.FriendlySQLServerVersion function reports the SQL Server Version as a string with commonly used moniker e.g. 2008R2 or 2019.
3. tSQLt is now certified for SQL Server on Linux.

MISCELLANEOUS:

1. Created GitHub Action for building and testing tSQLt on MSSQL 2017 and 2019 using Redgate Spawn.
2. Refactored Azure DevOps Pipeline to use more powerful VMs and azcli to create the SQLVM with a bicep file.
3. Migrated parts of the tSQLt build from ant to PowerShell. 
4. Prototyped using AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) to host MSSQL 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019.
5. Prototyped Facade dacpacs for use in Visual Studio when developing tests with tSQLt. Ultimately we chose a full tSQLt dacpac for this work, but continue to retain the original Facade code and tests.


---------------------------
Release: V1.0.7682.21917

BUG FIXES:

1. Fix sysname casing for case-sensitive databases. Fixed by Trygve Wastvedt (https://github.com/twastvedt).

2. Fixed issue in tSQLt.Private_GetFullTypeName not handling fractional seconds precision on date and time types. Fixed by saperry (https://github.com/saperry).

NEW FEATURES:

1. FakeFunction now accepts non-functions as data sources for example tables or SELECT statements. Contributed by Dmitrij Kultasev (https://github.com/dkultasev).

MISCELLANEOUS:

1. For tSQLt contributors: allow SQL Server Authentication for build

---------------------------
Release: V1.0.7597.5637

BUG FIXES:

N/A

NEW FEATURES:

1. The tSQLt CLR is now signed with a new key:

    Public key (hash algorithm: sha1):
    0024000004800000940000000602000000240000525341310004000001000100b9af416ad8dfed
    ec08a5652fa257f1242bf4ed60ef5a7b84a429604d62c919c5663a9c7710a7c5df9953b69ec89f
    ce85d71e051140b273f4c9bf890a2bc19c48f22d7b1f1d739f90eebc5729555f7f8b63ed088bbb
    083b336f7e38b92d44cfe1c842f09632b85114772ff2122bc638c78d497c4e88c2d656c166050d
    6e1ef394

    Public key token is e8fff6f136d7b53e

2. Several improvements to the build process, including switching from NAnt to Ant

3. New prepare server process (this fixes all installation issues with 2017 and 2019)
   
   Before installing tSQLt, you can now run the PrepareServer.sql that is part of the tSQLt.zip download.
   It automatically enables CLR and installs a server certificate that allows the installation of the CLR.
   There is no need to disable strict CLR security on the server nor do you need to modify database security settings.
   Executing the script requires SA permissions, but needs to be done only once per server.

   Reminder: If you are using the tSQLt.NewConnection feature, 
             you need to execute tSQLt.EnableExternalAccess after each installation of tSQLt.

4. Annotations

   tSQLt now allows for test case annotations to modify test behavior. The annotations implemented so far are:

   --[@tSQLt:MaxSqlMajorVersion](@MaxVersion) <-- Skips the test if the major version of SQL Server is > @MaxVersion
   --[@tSQLt:MinSqlMajorVersion](@MinVersion) <-- Skips the test if the major version of SQL Server is < @MinVersion
   --[@tSQLt:Skip](@SkipReason)               <-- Skips the test and reports @SkipReason as reason in the output

5. Implemented a CI pipeline for tSQLt itself in Azure DevOps

---------------------------
Release: V1.0.5873.27393

BUG FIXES:

1. Fixed error message in tSQLt.FakeTable

2. tSQLt.DropClass now handles already quoted names correctly

NEW FEATURES:

1. The tSQLt CLR is now signed with a new key:
   Public Key Token = 0x7722217d36028e4c
   Public Key: 0x0602000000240000525341310004000001000100F7D9A45F2B508C2887A8794B053CE5DEB28743B7C748FF545F1F51218B684454B785054629C1417D1D3542B095D80BA171294948FCF978A502AA03240C024746B563BC29B4D8DCD6956593C0C425446021D699EF6FB4DC2155DE7E393150AD6617EDC01216EA93FCE5F8F7BE9FF605AD2B8344E8CC01BEDB924ED06FD368D1D0
   The password required to sign an assembly with this key is no longer part of the code 
   base. This was necessary to be able to provide a secure method of installing tSQLt not 
   requiring the database to be set to TRUSTWORTHY anymore.

2. tSQLt.Info() now returns the public key token of the assembly's signing key in 
   the CLRSigningKey column

3. tSQLt.RunNew executes all tests in test classes (schemata) that were created with 
   tSQLt.NewTestClass after the last call to tSQLt.Reset

4. tSQLt.InstallExternalAccessKey installs the required objects in the master database 
   to allow tSQLt to execute with EXTERNAL_ACCESS without the database being TRUSTWORTHY

5. tSQLt.RemoveExternalAccessKey removes those objects from the master database

6. tSQLt.EnableExternalAccess can be used to manually enable and disable EXTERNAL_ACCESS

7. tSQLt automatically tries to enable EXTERNAL_ACCESS, each time any "run" method is called.
   Enabling EXTERNAL_ACCESS is possible when either the database is TRUSTWORTHY and owned
   by a server principal with EXTERNAL_ACCESS_ASSEMBLY permission, or if 
   tSQLt.InstallExternalAccessKey has been executed before on the server. 
   
   This feature establishes backward compatibillity but comes at a performance cost. 
   It might therefore be removed in a future version.

8. tSQLt detects at the beginning of each execution, if the requirements to enable 
   EXTERNAL_ACCESS are not any longer fulfilled. If the assembly is still marked as
   EXTERNAL_ACCESS, the execution is halted immediately, and an error is reported
   back to the caller.
   
9. tSQLt checks at the beginning of each execution, if the installed assembly's version
   matches the version of the T-SQL code. If a mismatch is detected, the execution is 
   immediately halted and an error is reported back to the caller.

A. tSQLt.Run now allows a test result formatter to be passed in in the @TestResultFormatter
   parameter. If that parameter is omitted or NULL, the default result formatter is used.
   
OTHER:

1. Cleaned up several procedures and tests

2. Removed extraneous DROP statements from tSQLt install file.

---------------------------
Release: V1.0.5793.20044

BUG FIXES:
1. AssertEqualsTableSchema now handles gaps in column_id values correctly (thanks Greg L.)
2. Fixed handling of empty messages in AssertEmptyTable

NEW FEATURES:
1. AssertStringIn asserts that a string value is element of a set of string values
2. ApplyConstraint can now apply cascading actions on foreign keys
3. FakeTable can now fake synonyms of tables and view (in the same database only, for now) 

OTHER:

---------------------------
Release: V1.0.5686.18945

BUG FIXES:
1. The XML output now validates against the JUnit test result XML schema at 
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windyroad/JUnit-Schema/master/JUnit.xsd
   While there is no "official" JUnit schema, the above is the one that is
   referenced most often online.

2. tSQLt.DropClass now handles XML schemata correctly.

3. All tSQLt assertions can now be called with a @Message parameter. In case of a
   failure, the value of that parameter will be output before the default failure
   message. 
   For backward compatibility, tSQLt.AssertEqualsTable still has a @FailMsg 
   parameter. Its use is now deprecated.

NEW FEATURES:
1. tSQLt.Info() now returns the version and build of the SQL Server Instance it is installed on:

   SELECT * FROM tSQLt.Info() AS I;

   Version        ClrVersion     SqlVersion SqlBuild
   -------------- -------------- ---------- --------
   1.0.5479.30419 1.0.5479.30419      12.00  4213.00

2. Verbose execution mode
   Executing EXEC tSQLt.SetVerbose @Verbose = 1; before running the tests will cause
   tSQLt to output the test name at the beginning and the end of each test's execution.
   That makes it easier in large test suites to find the output of a particular test.

3. tSQLt.RunC
   The new procedure tSQLt.RunC behaves identical to tSQLt.Run. However, instead of
   expecting the test (class) name in a parameter, it parses the INPUTBUFFER and
   extracts the name from a specially formed comment:
   
   EXEC tSQLt.RunC;--Run_Methods_Tests.[test tSQLt.RunC calls tSQLt.Run with everything after ;-- as @TestName]
   
   This makes for a more powerful SQL Query shortcut in SSMS as test names now do not have to be quoted anymore.
   
4. tSQLt.AssertEqualsTableSchema
   tSQLt.AssertEqualsTableSchema is called like tSQLt.AssertEqualsTable. Instead of 
   the table contents, it compares the columns including name, datatype, collation, 
   NULL-ability and identity property.

5. The test runner now captures start and end time for each test. This information
   is included in the XML output. The default output contains the execution duration
   for each test.

6. Both tSQLt.SpyProcedure and tSQLt.FakeFunction now handle table type parameters.
   The content of a table type parameter in a spied procedure is converted into
   XML and included in the _SpyProcedureLog table.

OTHER:

1. Farewell Sourceforge
   Because of several issues over the last months and because of even more complaints
   about Sourceforge's business practices by tSQLt users, we decided to find a more appropriate space.
   The official downloads are now available directly on tSQLt.org. The source code 
   repository will find its new home either on github or bitbucket over the next few days.

2. The fail message of tSQLt.AssertEqualsString is now broken into two lines
   with aligned string values for easier comparison.

3. The installation script now prints a welcome message.

OTHER:
1. New numbering system for the tSQLt builds. The current version is: V1.0.4351.28410
---------------------------

build.12:

BUG FIXES:
1. tSQLt.Fail now handles NULL values as parameters.
2. Corrected XmlResultFormatter to have root element of 'testsuites' instead of 'root'.
This improves compatibility with more continuous integration servers.

NEW FEATURES:
1. FakeTable now handles a single parameter, combining the schema and table name.
This makes FakeTable more consistent with other methods in tSQLt.
2. ApplyConstraint now handles two parameters, combining the schema and table 
name as the first parameter. This makes ApplyConstraint more consistent with other 
methods in tSQLt.

---------------------------

build.11:

BUG FIXES:
1. ApplyConstraint for a Foreign Key that references a Faked Table is fixed.
2. SetClrEnabled.sql utlity file now handles database names with spaces.
3. Test cases whose names contain a percent sign are now displayed correctly 
in the test case output.

NEW FEATURES:
1. Warnings about renaming objects displayed when executing FakeTable or 
ApplyConstraint are now hidden.
2. New method: tSQLt.SuppressOutput suppresses the console output that would
be displayed by executing a command.
3. New method: tSQLt.CaptureOutput logs the console output from executing a 
command into the tSQLt.CaptureOutputLog table.

---------------------------

build.10:

BUG FIXES:
1. Standardized capitalization of table, column, procedure and function names.

NEW FEATURES:
1. Added support for case sensitive databases.

---------------------------

build.9:

BUG FIXES:
1. When using tSQLt.Run or tSQLt.RunTestClass, if an object name on the dbo 
schema had the same name as a test class, the test class could not be executed.

2. If the output of an AssertTableEquals or the length of a test case name was 
too long, an error was be produced.

NEW FEATURES:
1. A new procedure, tSQLt.NewConnection, was added which allows statements to 
be executed synchronously in a different connection context.

---------------------------

build.8a:

BUG FIXES:
1. When executing tSQLt.ResultSetFilter, if the result set metadata contained 
hidden columns then those columns would be returned in the result set output.
The values of those columns would be null. Hidden columns are typically present
when the base tables of a result set contain primary keys or other constraints 
which were not selected. tSQLt.ResultSetFilter has been updated to not return 
the hidden columns.

---------------------------

build.8:

NEW FEATURES:
1. SpyProcedure now supports output parameters. Details are available in the 
User Guide. See: http://www2.sqlity.net/tsqlt/spyprocedure

2. The first major sections of the User Guide are now available at:
http://www.tsqlt.org - On the right hand side is a link for the User Guide.

---------------------------

build.7:

IMPORTANT: tSQLt now utilizes CLR (Common Language Runtime) stored procedures. 
In order to install tSQLt, CLRs must be enabled in SQL Server. The 
SetClrEnabled.sql file has the command which enables CLRs. If CLRs are not 
already enabled, this command must be executed before installing tSQLt.

NEW FEATURES:
1. A new procedure tSQLt.RunAll, executes all test classes created with the 
tSQLt.NewTestClass procedure.

2. Added procedure tSQLt.AssertResultSetsHaveSameMetaData which allows the 
meta data of two result sets to be compared. This compares several properties 
of each column of the result set including the column name, data type, length, 
precision, scale and other properties.

3. Added procedure tSQLt.ResultSetFilter which returns a single result set from
a statement which produces multiple result sets. For example, you want to test 
a stored procedure which executes several select statements. You can now use
ResultSetFilter to choose which result set to emit, and therefore you can 
capture that result set into a table for use with tSQLt.AssertEqualsTable.

4. The results of running tests can now be output in an XML format. After 
calling one of the tSQLt.Run... procedures to execute your test cases, you 
can call tSQLt.XmlResultFormatter to display the results in XML. The format is 
compatible with CruiseControl and can be merged into a build log the same way 
that a JUnit test report is merged.
